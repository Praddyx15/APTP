# Advanced Pilot Training Platform

## Overview

The Advanced Pilot Training Platform (APTP) is a next-generation flight training management system that far exceeds current industry solutions. It integrates state-of-the-art features across scheduling, instructor/student management, document processing, compliance, assessments, real-time analytics, immersive visualization, collaboration, and advanced AI capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive and Predictive Scheduling**: AI-driven resource optimization and predictive planning
- **Instructor & Trainee Management**: Personalized learning paths and digital logbooks
- **Document & Compliance Processing**: Multi-format ingestion with OCR and AI content extraction
- **Advanced Assessments & Adaptive Learning**: Competency-based evaluation with biometric integrations
- **Real-Time Analytics & Visualization**: Customizable dashboards with 3D/AR cockpit simulations
- **Enhanced Communication & Collaboration**: Integrated messaging with smart workspaces
- **Mobile & Offline Support**: Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
- **AI Integration**: On-device inference, federated learning, and knowledge graph engine

## Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with a React/Next.js frontend and C++/Python backend services:

### Frontend (Next.js, TypeScript, React)
- Modern UI with Material UI and Tailwind CSS
- Real-time data visualization with D3.js and Three.js
- Progressive Web App support with offline capabilities
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### Backend (C++, Python)
- High-performance C++ services using the Drogon framework
- Python-based AI/ML microservices for analytics and document processing
- Secure communication with AES-256 encryption and TLS 1.3
- Blockchain-backed audit trails for compliance data

### Databases
- PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series data
- MongoDB for unstructured document storage
- Redis for caching and real-time messaging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- C++ development environment with CMake
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- MongoDB 5+
- Redis 6+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/advanced-pilot-training-platform.git
   cd advanced-pilot-training-platform
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8000
   - Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:8000/swagger

### Development Workflow

#### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Backend Development
```bash
# For C++ services
cd backend/[service-name]
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./[service-name]_service

# For Python services
cd backend/[service-name]/python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Deployment

The platform is designed for deployment to cloud environments using container orchestration:

### Vercel Deployment (Frontend)
The Next.js frontend is configured for Vercel deployment with:
- Optimized build process
- API proxy configuration via `vercel.json`
- Environment variable integration

### Containerized Microservices (Backend)
Backend services are containerized and can be deployed to:
- AWS ECS/EKS
- Azure Container Instances/AKS
- Google Cloud Run/GKE

CI/CD pipelines are configured through GitHub Actions.
