- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Elasticsearch for search functionality
- Prometheus for monitoring
- Grafana for dashboards

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/advanced-pilot-training-platform.git
   cd advanced-pilot-training-platform
   ```

2. Create `.env` file with required environment variables:
   ```
   DB_USER=atp_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER=admin
   GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin_password
   ```

3. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Verify deployment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
   ```

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

- C++ development environment (C++17 or later)
- Python 3.8 or later
- Drogon framework
- PostgreSQL client libraries
- OpenSSL development libraries

### Building Individual Services

Each service can be built and run independently during development:

```bash
# Example for building Document Intelligence Service
cd document-service
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./document_service
```

### Testing

Each service includes unit tests that can be run with:

```bash
cd service-directory/build
make test
```

## Integration with Frontend

The frontend application communicates with the backend via the API Gateway, which routes requests to the appropriate service. All API endpoints follow RESTful conventions and return JSON responses.

See the [Frontend Implementation Guide](../frontend/README.md) for details on integrating with the frontend application.

## Security Considerations

- All communication between services uses TLS encryption
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- JWT tokens with short expiration are used for authentication
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Role-based access control restricts permissions
- Audit logging tracks all system activity

## Performance Optimization

- C++ is used for performance-critical services
- Response caching with Redis
- Database query optimization
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Horizontal scaling for high-load services
