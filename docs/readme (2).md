# Advanced Pilot Training Platform

A next-generation flight training management system that offers intelligent scheduling, document processing, compliance tracking, real-time analytics, adaptive assessments, and advanced AI integrations.

## Architecture Overview

The Advanced Pilot Training Platform is built as a modern, scalable application with the following components:

- **Backend**: Modern C++ (C++17/20) with the Drogon framework for high-performance microservices
- **AI/ML Services**: Python microservices for machine learning and data analysis
- **Frontend**: Next.js React application with responsive UI and advanced visualizations
- **Mobile**: Cross-platform mobile app for on-the-go access
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
- **Messaging**: Redis for caching and pub/sub messaging
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for document indexing and search

## Key Features

- 📚 **AI-Powered Training Syllabus Management**: Auto-generate structured training syllabi from uploaded documents
- 📊 **Real-Time Performance Analytics**: Track reaction time, cognitive workload, and procedural compliance
- 📝 **Electronic Training Records**: Comprehensive digital records with compliance tracking
- 🔄 **Adaptive Learning System**: Personalized training paths using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing
- 📱 **Multi-platform Access**: Web, desktop, and mobile interfaces
- 🔒 **Zero-Trust Security**: AES-256 encryption, TLS 1.3, blockchain audit trails
- 🌐 **Simulator Integration**: High-frequency data processing from flight simulators
- 🎮 **Gamification Elements**: Achievement tracking and personalized training challenges
