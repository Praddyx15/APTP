# Advanced Pilot Training Platform

A next-generation flight training management system that integrates advanced scheduling, syllabus building, document management, adaptive assessments, real-time analytics, immersive 3D/AR visualizations, and enhanced collaboration tools.

## Architecture Overview

The Advanced Pilot Training Platform is built as a set of microservices using Modern C++ (C++17/20) with the Drogon framework for the backend APIs and Python for AI/ML tasks. The frontend is built using Next.js and React with TypeScript.

### Backend Components

The backend is organized into the following modules:

- **Core**: Shared utilities for configuration, logging, error handling, and database access
- **Document**: Document processing pipeline and AI-based content extraction
- **Syllabus**: Syllabus generation engine and training structure creation
- **Assessment**: Competency-based assessment, grading, and biometric integrations
- **User Management**: Authentication, digital logbooks, and role-based dashboards
- **Scheduler**: AI-driven scheduling and resource optimization module
- **Analytics**: Real-time performance analytics and predictive insights
- **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance engine, audit trails, and document verification
- **Collaboration**: Backend support for virtual workspaces and messaging integration
- **Visualization**: Data services for 3D/AR knowledge maps and simulation visualizers
- **Integration**: Connectors for simulators, biometric devices, enterprise systems, and calendars
- **Security**: Zero-trust security, blockchain audit trails, and ethical AI governance
- **AI Modules**: Python-based AI/ML modules for document understanding, performance prediction, and research assistance

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Document Processing**: Extract structured data from aviation training documents
- **Advanced Syllabus Builder**: Create and manage training syllabi with regulatory mapping
- **Competency-Based Assessment**: Digital grading with biometric data integration
- **AI-Driven Scheduling**: Optimize resource allocation and training schedules
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Monitor training effectiveness and predict trainee outcomes
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated mapping to FAA, EASA, ICAO regulations
- **Collaboration Tools**: Smart workspaces with co-editing and instructor-trainee communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- CMake 3.15+
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 13+ with TimescaleDB extension
- Redis

### Installation with Docker

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/advanced-pilot-training-platform.git
cd advanced-pilot-training-platform
```

2. Build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. The application will be available at http://localhost:8080

### Manual Installation

1. Build the C++ components:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

2. Set up the Python environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the database:

```bash
psql -U postgres -f sql/init.sql
```

4. Run the server:

```bash
./aptp_server
```

### Building and Testing

The project uses CMake for building and Google Test for C++ unit testing:

```bash
# Build the project
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# Run the tests
cd build
ctest
```

Python tests use pytest:

```bash
cd backend/ai-modules
python -m pytest
```

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `/api/docs` when the server is running. The platform uses OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation.
