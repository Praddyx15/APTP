## 3. Inter-Service Communication

### Communication Patterns

1. **Synchronous Request-Response**: Used for direct service-to-service API calls via gRPC
2. **Asynchronous Messaging**: Used for events and background processing
3. **Database Sharing**: Each service has its own schema in a shared PostgreSQL database

### Authentication Flow

1. Client authenticates with Core Platform Service
2. Core Platform Service issues JWT token
3. Client includes token in requests to API Gateway
4. API Gateway validates token with Core Platform Service
5. API Gateway forwards authenticated requests to appropriate services
6. Services validate token with Core Platform Service

### Data Flow Examples

#### Training Session Recording
1. Data Acquisition Service collects real-time data from simulators and devices
2. Data is processed, filtered, and fused in real-time
3. Session data is stored in time-series database
4. ETR Service creates training record linked to session data
5. AI Analytics Service processes session data for performance metrics
6. Assessment Service generates preliminary grading based on metrics
7. Instructor reviews and finalizes assessment
8. Compliance checks are triggered against regulatory requirements

#### Syllabus Generation
1. Document Service extracts content from regulatory documents
2. AI Syllabus Generator creates draft syllabus based on regulations
3. Draft syllabus is reviewed and modified by training designers
4. Syllabus is approved and digitally signed
5. ETR Service links syllabus to training programs
6. Assessment Service configures grading criteria based on syllabus

## 4. Data Model

### Core Data Entities

1. **Users**: Trainees, instructors, administrators
2. **Training Records**: Session data, assessments, grades
3. **Syllabi**: Training programs, courses, exercises
4. **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory mappings, certification requirements
5. **Documents**: Training materials, regulations, procedures
6. **Assessment Criteria**: Grading scales, competency definitions
7. **Session Data**: Raw and processed data from training sessions

### Database Organization

- PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
- Service-specific schemas:
  - `core`: Users, roles, permissions
  - `etr`: Training records, signatures, compliance
  - `acquisition`: Device data, session recordings
  - `analytics`: Performance metrics, predictions
  - `document`: Document metadata, categories
  - `syllabus`: Training programs, courses, exercises
  - `assessment`: Grading criteria, assessments

## 5. Security Architecture
